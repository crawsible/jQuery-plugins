        <p>This intensely loyal breed was bred to be a seafaring working dog. He worked on fishing boats, retrieving things from the water, carrying messages between boats, herding fish, and even guarding the catch from seals. He is highly energetic and tireless, and as a family pet, will need lots of activity to keep him happy. He is exceptionally intelligent and takes well to obedience training. Today, the Portuguese Water Dog excels at obedience, agility, flyball, rally, herding, and drafting competitions. And as you might guess, he loves to play in the water. This is a dog who is happiest when he gets rigorous exercise each and every day. If he does not get enough exercise, he will get into mischief. The breed does well with children who know how to behave around dogs, but parents should supervise, as this is a big dog who plays hard. He makes a good watch dog, because he is big, with a loud, deep bark, and is cautious with strangers. He bonds easily with his family and becomes protective. He thrives on and demands human attention and will not do well if left alone for hours at a time. The Portuguese Water Dog is said to possess a unique sense of humor, and so should his humans, as these independent, spirited dogs stay quite active well into their senior years.

        <p>One word: feisty. These little guys are full of energy and character, and can be alarmingly assertive. In fact, some people find their energy levels to be overwhelming, and the Jack Russell will not do well with a confined living arrangement or a sedate lifestyle. They need to be busy and they need a lot of exercise! They are both a working dog and a companion dog, and are equally adept at killing rats in your barn or beating the crap out of your slipper. They are highly intelligent and will amuse you for hours on end. But you will earn it, as they seem to need an extraordinary amount of human attention and discipline. If you don't train them, they will train you. Jack Russells tend to be aggressive with other dogs and will chase cats and other small animals. They are bold and fearless little guys and are not intimidated by other dogs of any size. The Jack Russell is first and foremost a hunting dog, so is bred to bark, follow a scent, roam around, and dig. Be careful that you don't lose sight of them, as they have been known to go on hunting binges, and can stay "lost," underground, in pursuit of their prey, for days on end. They will need a fenced-in yard to romp around in, because it is nearly impossible for them to get enough exercise on a leash. You will need to be committed to ensuring that the fence is secure, because Jack Russells are escape artists. They can also climb fences. The Jack Russell is an extremely loyal and loving family pet and will do well with gentle children. However, a Jack Russell will not tolerate abuse from anyone, certainly not a child, even if the child doesn't know any better. Jack Russell Terriers will be hopelessly devoted to you, and might even become possessive of you. They do not do well when left alone for extended periods of time. So be prepared for a full-time, high maintenance, best friend!

        <p>The Shetland Sheepdog, affectionately called the "Sheltie," is one of the most trainable and loving breeds there is. They are incredibly intelligent and in tune to their owners thoughts and moods. They can be almost psychic when it comes to knowing what you are feeling. If you want to play, your Sheltie is ready to play. If you are sad, your Sheltie will show concern with a worried look and a few kisses. If you are not in the mood, your Sheltie will give you your space. They are sensitive and responsive to training, and sometimes respond to commands before they are given. They are one of the top breeds in the obedience ring, but they also excel in agility, herding, and flyball. They need a moderate amount of exercise every day, and they are happiest when they get this exercise outdoors. They are a working dog and they need a job to do. They need something to occupy their minds. If you don't give them something, they will think of something on their own, which is usually not a good thing. They are also devoted companions and family dogs and are especially fond of children. They will want to be involved in everything you do and go everywhere you go. They will follow you from room to room, including the restroom. They are also protective, especially of "their" children, and will bark a warning whenever someone nears your door. They are sound sensitive and bark at all strange sounds, even the ones you never hear. Barking can be a problem with Shelties, as they seem to have a lot to say. They are very expressive and talk to you with whines, groans, grunts and a thousand different barks. (They can also smile.) Not only will they bark at you, they may also try to herd you. But it's not personal. They will also try to herd children, bicycles, joggers, cars, ducks, and sometimes airplanes. They are usually naturally distrustful of strangers and should be socialized early in life. They are safest in a home with a fenced-in yard. They are peaceful other dogs and animals. A Sheltie needs to be a part of the family. They are an intensely loyal dog and will not do well if left alone. They love their families and crave human interaction. Owning a Sheltie is a 24-7 endeavor. They love attention. They love to learn. They love to please you. They also love to bark and to steal food from your children.
